7 days mini project using python,AIML

## DAY-1 PROBLEM STUDY

## PROJECT ABSTRACT

Early identification of lung abnormalities is essential for effective treatment and disease management.This project presents an AI-based system that analyzes chest X-ray images using deep learning tecniques to detect abnormal network is trained to extract visual features and classify X-rays as normal or abnormal.The system supports early screening and assists healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making.



## 🔎ABJECTIVE FOR DAY-1

The goal of Day 1 is to collect the required dataset and set up the development environment for the project.Today's focus is only on preparing the resources needed for model building in upcoming days.
